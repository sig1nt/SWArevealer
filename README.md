# SWArevealer

This is an implementation of the attack described in https://pushsecurity.com/blog/okta-swa/, all credit for discovery goes to them. I was specifically interested in the threat of "An attacker who has user credentials on an account which has password visibility disabled can get access to passwords". This tools still needs a ton of polish, but at least now I won't forget how to do the attack on my next Red Team engagement. The ideal state is that this tool takes creds and does a full enumeration, but one step at a time ;).
